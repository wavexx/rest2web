==============================
 Test of Uservalues in a Page
==============================

This tests the ``file`` keyword in a page that isn't an index page, but is a
subdirectory.

It should automatically copy the source for this document; `page.txt <page.txt>`_.

It also has all the same uservalue tests as before.

Uservalues
==========

This is a test of uservalues. The following paragraph is in ReStructuredText.

    <* test1 *>

The next one is in HTML :

    {esc;test2}

Some Title
==========

The following uservalues come from the global ones passed in the config file
and at the command line.

This paragraph should say **A Value** :

    <* uservalue1 *>

If you override the default value at the command line, this should say 
**The real uservalue2.** :

    <* uservalue2 *>

If you pass the value in at the command line, this should say
**A value for uservalue3.** :

    <$
    
        try:
            print uservalue3
        except NameError:
            print 'uservalue3 was missing. {sm;:-(}'
    
    $>
