====================
 Test of Uservalues
====================

This set of pages test *uservalues*, the *file keyword* and also passing an
alternative template at the command line.

If you created this document using the method described in `README.txt <README.txt>`_,
then this page will say **The Correct Template** at the top.

If the ``file`` keywords have all worked, then the links in the body of these
pages should all work.

It should be obvious if the uservalues have worked. {sm;:-)}

This is a test of uservalues. The following paragraph is in ReStructuredText.

    <* test1 *>

The next one is in HTML :

    {esc;test2}

Some Title
==========

The following uservalues come from the global ones passed in the config file
and at the command line.

This paragraph should say **A Value** :

    <* uservalue1 *>

If you override the default value at the command line, this should say 
**The real uservalue2.** :

    <* uservalue2 *>

If you pass the value in at the command line, this should say
**A value for uservalue3.** :

    <$
    
        try:
            print uservalue3
        except NameError:
            print 'uservalue3 was missing. {sm;:-(}'
    
    $>
