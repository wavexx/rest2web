    crumb: Force Mode
    page-description:
        A special mode (set from the command line) allows **rest2web** to build
        a website from a collection of ReST documents. In this mode templates,
        index pages and restindexes are optional.

Introduction
============

Sometimes you just want to throw some ReST documents together as HTML. Or
perhaps you need to keep your documents in normal ReST syntax, and you don't
want to add a ``restindex``.

In this case, you want the *force mode*. {sm;:-)}

In essence the force mode makes templates, restindexes and index pages
optional. It does this by supplying defaults where they are missing.

The default template (complete with sidebar) and default index page are stored
in the ``rest2web/defaults/`` directory. You are of course free to edit them. 

.. note::

    This functionality is new, and needs to mature. For example, at the moment
    you will probably want to edit the supplied defaults.
    
    An obvious feature to add would be to allow the overriding of the defaults
    at the command line.
    
    If you have any opinions about how this feature should develop, then please
    comment on the `rest2web-develop mailing list <http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/rest2web-develop>`_.

Files in your site can still be contained in a directory tree. rest2web will
create an index page for each directory, and link between them via the index
pages, sidebar and breadcrumbs.


Using Force Mode
================

You activate force mode through the command line, with either the ``-f`` or
``--force`` option.

When force is on and no template is specified, then the default one
(``restweb/defaults/template.txt``) is used.

If a template is specified in the restindex of any index page, then that will
be used for that directory (and all subdirectories) in the usual way.

Every directory that has no ``index.txt`` will use the default one.
(``restweb/defaults/index.txt``)

Every text file without a restindex will be assumed to be in ReST format. It
will use the normal defaults for a restindex.

The index page for the top level will have the title *Index for Site*.

Other index pages will have *Site* replaced with the directory name.

The page title will be used as the crumb and link-title for all pages.


Force Mode and Config File
==========================

If you are in force mode, the config file is also optional.

In this case, the current directory is used as the source directory.

The output is put into a subdirectory called 'html'. This directory will be created if it doesn't exist, it will also not be scanned for source text files.
