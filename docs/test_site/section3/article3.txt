 Article 3
=============

This article has nearly the smallest restindex possible ! If it was in the 'default' section [#]_, it would have the smallest one possible. 


.. [#] The *default section* is where articles without a section specified are put. In your index page template, you access the articles in this section using ``pages[None]``.
