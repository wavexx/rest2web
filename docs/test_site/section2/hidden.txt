=====================
 The Hidden Page
=====================

There's not a lot to see here, which is probably why it wasn't included in the index. It illustrates that you can have **rest2web** build pages, including navigation links, but not include them in the indexes. 

It doesn't appear in the sidebar either. This may or may not be a good thing of course {sm;:grin:}.
