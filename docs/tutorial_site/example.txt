    This is a comment. To use the 'raw-role', we have to define it *first*.

.. role:: raw-html(raw)
    :format: html

This page is written in {acro;reST;ReStructured Text} markup. That's why it looks like *plain text*.

This page lives at :raw-html:`<em><% pagepath %></em>` [#]_. This tutorial isn't a tutorial on ReStructuredText though. If you're looking for one, you might be better off with the `docutils documentation`_.
